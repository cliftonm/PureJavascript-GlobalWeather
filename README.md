# PureJavascript-GlobalWeather
Reworking CP article into pure Javascript to contrast with Angular 7 development

Based on the work here: https://www.codeproject.com/Articles/1274513/Angular-7-with-NET-Core-2-2-Global-Weather-Part-1

Working in so-called modern frameworks results in an inordinant amount of overhead, complexity, and package dependence.  The result is difficult to maintain by developers that lack or have different technology knowledge, and is brittle when it comes time to upgrade to the latest version of the framework and dependent packages.  Fear of upgrade / breaking changes results in web applications becoming technologically obsolete as they become years behind in the latest and greatest version.

The article in the aformentioned link is quite excellent.  It's also the perfect target for demonstrating how pure Javascript is simpler, easier to maintain, and frankly results in faster development, at least in my opinion.  Yes, there are times when packages are really useful, but I have yet to see a good reason to adopt one of these frameworks.
